This repository contains all the tested files about commputer architecture lab. In this Lab, we successfully built a three stage pipelined processor, the advanced version of SingleCycleProcessor.
It is basically a version of 5 stage RISC-V pipelined processor.
We also controlled the data and control hazards in it and there is a project called Branch predictor which predicts the branch instruction and control the control hazard in 3 our 3 stage pipelined processor.
All the draw.io are also added for better visualization of the working.
All the testbenchs have been added also.
