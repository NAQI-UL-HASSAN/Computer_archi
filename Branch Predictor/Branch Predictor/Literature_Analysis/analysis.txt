- did not use static branch prediction because it cannot adapt to dynamic changes in branch behavior. this can be mitigated by a dynamic compiler, but not at a fine granularity and it has its overheads.
- static BP is at compile time.
- dynamic BP is at runtime. less work for the compiler.
- dynamic more powerful than static as it predicts based on the history of the branches and dynamic behavior wala problem bhi solved.

###### Last time prediction
- good for large forloops 
- miss predicticts first and last condition of loop. (N-2)/N accuracy
- CPI 1.06 85% accuracy

###### Two bit Counter
- (N-1)/N accuracy if start for weakly taken.
- CPI 1.04 90% accuracy
- trade off hardware cost

###### Global/Local Branch Correlation 
- complex and extra extra hardware
- accuracy good

###### Hybrid Branch Correlation 
- longer access latency

will use 2bit because its a balance between hardware and accuracy (3 stage pipeline).
